    release_date: '2021-11-10'
  0.40.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Fix ``rsync`` flags in build scripts generated by ``antsibull-docs sphinx-init``
          to allow Sphinx to not rebuild unchanged files (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/357).
        - Fix boolean logic error when ``--skip-indexes`` was used in ``antsibull-docs``
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/377).
        - Fix feature freeze handling after Beta 1 in build role (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/337).
        - Require Python 3.8 for Ansible 5 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/345).
      deprecated_features:
        - The ``antsibull-build single`` subcommand is deprecated. Use the ``prepare``
          and ``rebuild-single`` subcommands instead (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/341).
      major_changes:
        - Responsive parameter and return value tables. Also use RST tables instead
          of HTML blobs (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/335).
      minor_changes:
        - Add a changelog (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/378).
        - Allow to specify ``collection_cache`` in config file (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/375).
        - Allow to still use HTML blobs for parameter and return value tables. This
          can be controlled by a CLI option ``--use-html-blobs`` and by a global config
          option ``use_html_blobs`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/360).
        - Avoid prereleases when creating the ``.build`` file in ``antsibull-build
          new-acd``. The old behavior of including them can be obtained by passing
          the ``--allow-prereleases`` option (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/298).
        - Change ansible-base references in documentation and code to ansible-core
          where it makes sense (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/353).
        - During docs build, only write/copy files to the destination that have changed
          assuming they are not too large (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/374).
        - Improve ``build-ansible.sh`` script integrated in the release tarball (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/369).
        - Improve ``galaxy-requirements.yaml`` generation (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/350).
        - Mention new options in the porting guide (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/363).
        - Modify ``thread_max`` default value from 80 to 8 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/365,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/370).
        - Move modules to beginning of plugin index (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/336).
        - Remove unnecessary Python 2 boilerplates (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/371).
        - Simplify ansible-core dependency in ``setup.py`` with compatibility operator
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/346).
        - Split ``antsibull-build single`` subcommand into ``prepare`` and ``rebuild-single``
          subcommand (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/341).
        - Stop using deprecated Python standard library ``distutils.version`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/372).
        - Various improvements to the build role (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/338).

  0.40.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Fix bug in collection enum for docs generation, which caused role FQCNs
          to be mangled (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/379).

  0.40.2:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Fix ``rsync`` call when ``antsibull-docs sphinx-init`` is used with ``--squash-hieararchy``
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/382).
        - Fix invalid HTML in return value RST tables. Closing ``</div>`` were missing
          for a wrapping ``<div>`` of every content cell, causing problems with some
          text-based browsers (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/issues/386,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/387).
        - Work around Python argparse bug by using vendored class for all Python versions
          until the bug is fixed in argparse. This makes ``--help`` work for all antsibull-docs
          subcommands (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/384).
      release_summary: Bugfix release.

    release_date: '2022-01-14'
  0.41.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - If plugin parsing fails for ``antsibull-docs plugin``, handle this more
          gracefully (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/393).
        - Improve error message when plugin specified for ``antsibull-docs plugin``
          cannot be found (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/383).
        - When using ``--use-html-blobs``, malformed HTML was generated for parameter
          aliases (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/388).
      minor_changes:
        - Add ``--fail-on-error`` to all antsibull-docs subcommands for usage in CI
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/393).
        - Allow to select a different Sphinx theme for ``antsibull-docs sphinx-init``
          with the new ``--sphinx-theme`` option (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/392).
        - Fully implement ``antsibull-docs collection``. So far ``--current`` was
          required (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/383).
        - Mention the plugin type more prominently in the documentation (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/364).
        - Remove email addresses and ``(!UNKNOWN)`` from plugin and role author names
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/389).
        - Support new ``keyword`` field in plugin documentations (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/329).
        - The ``conf.py`` generated by ``antsibull-docs sphinx-init`` will be set
          to try resolving intersphinx references to Ansible's ``devel`` docs instead
          of a concrete Ansible version (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/391).
      release_summary: Feature and bugfix release.

  0.42.0b1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Fix filename of mentioned ansible-core porting guide in Ansible's porting
          guide introductionary comment (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/398).
        - antsibull-docs will no longer traceback when it tries to process plugins
          not found in its own constant but are available in ansible-core (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/404).
      major_changes:
        - Building Ansible 6+ now builds wheels next to the source tarball (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/394).
        - Remove Ansible 2.9 / ansible-base 2.10 checks from ``setup.py`` for Ansible
          6 so that we can finally ship wheels. This change is only active for Ansible
          6 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/394).
      minor_changes:
        - Change more references to ansible-base to ansible-core in the code (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/398).
        - Mention the ``ansible-core`` major version in the Ansible porting guide
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/397).
        - Redo attributes table using the same structure as the options and return
          value table. This improves its look and adds a linking mechanism (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/401).
      release_summary: Beta release to allow merging of https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/74963.

  0.42.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Fix ansible-core version parsing for ``ansible-doc`` docs parsing backend
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/401).
      major_changes:
        - Allow collections to specify extra links (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/355).
        - From Ansible 6 on, improve ``setup.py`` to exclude unnecessary files in
          the Python distribution (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/342).
      minor_changes:
        - Add a new docs parsing backend ``ansible-core-2.13``, which supports ansible-core
          2.13+ (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/401).
        - Add an autodetection ``auto`` for the docs parsing backend to select the
          fastest supported backend. This is the new default (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/401).
        - Add option ``--no-semantic-versioning`` to ``antsibull-lint changelog-yaml``
          command (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/405).
        - If the role is used to build a non-alpha or first beta version and the bulid
          file does not exist, it is created instead of later failing because it does
          not exist (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/408).
      release_summary: Major feature release preparing for Ansible 6. Also adds support
        for the new collection links file, and improves the attributes tables.

  0.42.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - antsibull-docs sphinx-init - the ``--fail-on-error`` option resulted in
          an invalid ``build.sh`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/409).
      release_summary: Bugfix release.

  0.43.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Prevent crashing when non-strings are found for certain pathnames for ``antsibull-docs
          lint-collection-docs`` and ``antsibull-lint collection-docs`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/411).
      minor_changes:
        - Add ``lint-collection-docs`` subcommand to ``antsibull-docs``. It behaves
          identical to ``antsibull-lint collection-docs`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/411,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/issues/410).
        - Support ``MANIFEST.json`` and not only ``galaxy.yml`` for ``antsibull-docs
          lint-collection-docs`` and ``antsibull-lint collection-docs`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/411).
      release_summary: Feature release.

      - 0.43.0.yml
      - 411-lint-collection-docs.yml
    release_date: '2022-03-30'
  0.44.0:
    changes:
      deprecated_features:
        - The antsibull-lint command is deprecated. Use ``antsibull-changelog lint-changelog-yaml``
          instead of ``antsibull-lint changelog-yaml``, and use ``antsibull-docs lint-collection-docs``
          instead of ``antsibull-lint collection-docs`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/412,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/issues/410).
      known_issues:
        - When upgrading from antsibull < 0.44.0 to antsibull 0.44.0+, it could happen
          that the ``antsibull-docs`` binary is removed due to how pip works. To make
          sure the ``antsibull-docs`` binary is present, either first uninstall (``pip
          uninstall antsibull``) before installing the latest antsibull version, or
          re-install ``antsibull-docs`` once the installation finished (``pip install
          --force-reinstall antsibull-docs``) (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/414).
      major_changes:
        - The ``antsibull`` package now depends on ``antsibull-core`` and ``antsibull-docs``,
          and most code was moved to these two packages. The ``antsibull-docs`` CLI
          tool is now part of the ``antsibull-docs`` package as well. The behavior
          of the new version should be identical to the previous version (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/414).
      release_summary: Split up antsibull into multiple PyPi packages (``antsibull-core``,
        ``antsibull-docs``, and ``antsibull``). **Note** that upgrading is a bit more
        complicated due to the way ``pip`` works! See below for details.

    release_date: '2022-04-10'
  0.45.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
        - The ``build-release`` role no longer uses poetry to run antsibull, but assumes
          that antsibull is installed. To revert to the old behavior, set the Ansible
          variable ``antsibull_build_command`` to ``poetry run antsibull`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/420).
      minor_changes:
        - Add ``antsibull-build`` subcommand ``validate-deps`` which validates dependencies
          for an ``ansible_collections`` tree (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/416).
        - Check collection dependencies during ``antsibull-build rebuild-single``
          and warn about errors (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/416).
        - In the ``build-release`` role, stop shipping a separate ``roles/build-release/files/deps-to-galaxy.py``
          script and use the new galaxy-requirements.yaml style file created during
          release preparation (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/417).
        - Update Ansible's ``README.rst`` to focus on Ansible package details (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/415).
        - When preparing a new Ansible release with ``antsibull-build prepare`` or
          ``antsibull-build single``, create a galaxy-requirements.yaml style file
          next to the dependencies file (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/417).

    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - In the build-release role, when ``antsibull_force_rebuild`` is true, delete
          the existing python wheel in addition to the release tarball (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/427).
        - Remove various empty lines from generated ``setup.py`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/issues/424,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/425).
        - Use ``packaging.version`` instead of (indirectly) ``distutils.version``
          to check whether the correct ansible-core version is installed (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/426).
      minor_changes:
        - Avoid including the complete condensed changelog of collections added to
          Ansible to that Ansible release's changelog and porting guide entries (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/428).
        - The ``build-release`` role now also uses ``antsibull_data_reset`` to prevent
          regeneration of ``build-X.ansible`` for alpha and beta-1 releases (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/422).

      bugfixes:
        - When preparing a new Ansible release, bump the ansible-core version to the
          latest bugfix version (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/430).
      minor_changes:
        - In the release role, automatically set ``antsibull_build_file`` and ``antsibull_data_dir``
          based on ``antsibull_ansible_version`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/430).

  0.49.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
        - The ``build-release`` role now depends on the ``community.general`` collection
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/432).
      bugfixes:
        - Fix typo in generated MANIFEST.in to list the existing file ``README.rst``
          instead of the non-existing file ``README`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/435).
        - When preparing a new Ansible release, only use pre-releases for ansible-core
          when the Ansible release itself is an alpha pre-release. This encodes that
          the first beta release of a new major Ansible release coincides with the
          ansible-core GA (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/436).
      minor_changes:
        - Allow to copy the files used to create the source distribution and wheels
          to a new directory during ``antsibull-build rebuild-single`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/435).
        - Perform minor refactoring of the ``build-release`` role, mostly concerning
          ``tasks/tests.yml``. This reduces use of ``shell`` and ``set_fact``, makes
          the role more robust, and replaces short names with FQCNs (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/432).
        - Show warnings emitted by building the source distribution and/or wheels
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/435).
        - The files in the source repository now follow the `REUSE Specification <https://reuse.software/spec/>`_.
          The only exceptions are changelog fragments in ``changelogs/fragments/``
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/437).

      bugfixes:
        - Adjust release role to work around a bug in the current beta version of
          ansible-core 2.14 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/447).
        - Fix typing errors in the ``multiple`` subcommand (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/443).
      minor_changes:
        - Added galaxy ``requirements.yml`` file as ``build-release`` role depends
          on ``community.general`` collection (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/432)
        - Define minimal Python requirement for Ansible X depending on X, under the
          assumption that ansible-core's Python requirement is increased by one version
          every two ansible-core major releases, and that every Ansible major release
          corresponds to an ansible-core major release from Ansible 5 on (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/448).
        - The ``build-release`` role fails to execute when ``./build/antsibull-build-data``
          doesn't exist and when the ``antsibull_data_reset`` variable is set to ``false``
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/442).
        - When building Ansible 6.3.0 or newer, fail on collection dependency validations
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/94, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/440).

        - Now requires antsibull-core >= 1.3.0 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/449).
        - The ``python_requires`` information is now extracted from ansible-core and
          stored in the ``.build`` and ``.deps`` files instead of guessing it from
          the Ansible version (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/449).

      bugfixes:
        - Add ``--collection-dir`` to the ``antsibull-build`` ``collection`` and ``build-collection``
          subcommands. Previously, the ``--collection-dir`` option was added to the
          wrong CLI argument parser and not exposed to users. (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/461).
        - Use compatibility code instead of trying to run ``asyncio.run`` directly,
          which will fail with Python 3.6 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/459).
      release_summary: Bugfix release. The next minor release will no longer support

        - The antsibull-docs dependency has been removed (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/451).
      minor_changes:
        - Add a ``validate-tags`` subcommand to ensure that collection versions in
          an Ansible release are tagged in collections' respective git repositories
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/456).
        - Make compatible with antsibull-core 2.x.y (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/463).

      removed_features:

          on your use-case (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/451).
        - The deprecated ``build-collection`` subcommand of ``antsibull-build`` has
          been removed. Use ``collection`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/451).
        - The deprecated ``build-multiple`` subcommand of ``antsibull-build`` has
          been removed. Use ``multiple`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/451).
        - The deprecated ``build-single`` subcommand of ``antsibull-build`` has been
          removed. Use ``single`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/451).
        - The deprecated ``new-acd`` subcommand of ``antsibull-build`` has been removed.

  0.53.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Correct Python version classifiers in the ansible ``setup.py`` template.
          Limit the Python 3.8 classifer to ansible 5 and 6 and add the Python 3.11
          classifier to ansible >= 7 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/479).
        - Do not crash when the ``changelogs/changelog.yaml`` file of a collection
          cannot be loaded (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/issues/481,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/482).
      minor_changes:
        - Add ``--tags-file`` option to the ``single``, ``rebuild-single``, and ``prepare``
          subcommands. This allows including a collection git tags data file in ansible-build-data
          and the ansible sdist (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/476/).
        - Add ``pyproject.toml`` to ansible sdist to use the ``setuptools.build_meta``
          `PEP 517 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/>`__ backend. Tools that still
          call ``setup.py`` directly will work the same as they did before (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/471).
        - Bump minimum ``antsibull-core`` requirement to 1.5.0. It contains changes
          that are needed for the new ``--tags-file`` option (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/476/).

          explicitly declare the dependencies on ``packaging``, ``semantic_version``,
          ``aiofiles``, ``aiohttp``, and ``twiggy`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/487).

    changes:
      deprecated_features:
        - The ``multiple`` and ``collection`` subcommands are deprecated and will
          be removed soon. They were never used to our knowledge except in the exploratory
          phase before the first Ansible 2.10 releases, have no test coverage, and
          might not even work at all. If you are actively using them and are interested
          in keeping them, please create an issue in the antsibull repository as soon
          as possible (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/505).
      major_changes:
        - Change pyproject build backend from ``poetry-core`` to ``hatchling``. ``pip
          install antsibull`` works exactly the same as before, but some users may
          be affected depending on how they build/install the project (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/490).
      minor_changes:
        - Add a ``-I`` / ``--ignore`` and a ``--ignores-file`` flag to the ``antsibull-build
          validate-tags`` and ``antsibull-build validate-tags-file`` subcommands to
          ignore errors for certain collections (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/491).
        - Make compatible with deprecations issued by newer setuptools releases (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/issues/433,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/502).
        - Use the pypa ``build`` tool to build wheels and source distributions for
          ansible in an isolated environment. This replaces direct calls to ``python
          setup.py bdist_wheel`` and ``python setup.py sdist`` which are deprecated
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/492).

          freeze (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/issues/532, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/533).
      minor_changes:
        - Antsibull now no longer depends directly on ``sh`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/514).
        - Antsibull now uses ``sys.executable`` instead of the first ``'python'``
          in ``$PATH`` to call the PyPA build tool (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/514).
        - Make ``dep_closure`` errors clearer by including the offending collection's
          version in the message (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/531).
        - Move setuptools configuration into the declarative ``setup.cfg`` format
          for Ansible 9 and above. ``ansible`` sdists will still contain a ``setup.py``
          file, but we recommend that users move to tools like ``pip`` and ``build``
          and the PEP 517 interface instead of setuptools' deprecated ``setup.py``
          interface (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/530).
        - Now depends antsibull-core 2.0.0 or newer; antsibull-core 1.x.y is no longer
          supported (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/514).
        - release playbook - run ``antsibull-build validate-tags-file`` to ensure
          that collections follow the Release Management section of the Collection
          Requirements (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/518).
      release_summary: This release adds a couple new features and drops support for
        older ansible versions.
      removed_features:
        - Remove code to build ansible versions < 6.0.0 from the ``setup.py`` template
          and elsewhere in the codebase. ``antsibull-build`` will error out if a user
          attempts to build an unsupported version (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/477,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/524).

      minor_changes:
        - Add a ``sanity-tests`` subcommand to run sanity tests accross the collection
          tree created by ``verify-upstreams`` and display the results (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/556).
        - Add a ``verify-upstreams`` subcommand to ensure that files in a collections'

        - Add support for the latest antsibull-core v3 pre-release, ``3.0.0a1`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/586).
        - Adjust the ``pip install antsibull`` call in the ``build-ansible.sh`` script
          added to the ``ansible`` source distribution to use the version of antsibull

        - Change the license from ``GPL-3.0-or-later`` to ``GPL-3.0-or-later AND Python-2.0.1``.

  0.62.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
        - The release role no longer automatically skips the ``prepare`` step when
          the ``.deps`` file already exists. If you need this behavior, set ``antsibull_skip_prepare=true``
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/598).
      minor_changes:
        - Add option ``--preserve-deps`` to the ``prepare`` subcommand that allows
          to preserve the dependencies if a ``.deps`` file for that version already
          exists. The versions from that ``.deps`` file are validated against the
          build requirements and constraints, and the remainder of the release preparation
          process remains unchanged. The release role allows to pass this flag when
          ``antsibull_preserve_deps=true`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/599).
        - Allow the release role to skip the ``prepare`` step by setting ``antsibull_skip_prepare=true``
          if the ``.deps`` file already exists (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/598).
        - The ``prepare`` subcommand will no longer overwrite an existing release
          summary in the ``changelog.yaml`` file (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/597).
        - Use feature freeze for all betas from ``b2`` on, and all release candidates
          in the release role (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/598).

  0.63.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
        - The release role now has a ``antsibull_build_reset`` option, which defaults
          to the value of ``antsibull_data_reset``, that allows to control whether
          ``.build`` files are reset during alpha and beta-1 releases (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/601).

          from CLI (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/602).
      minor_changes:
        - If you are using `argcomplete <https://pypi.org/project/argcomplete/>`__,
          you can now tab-complete ``antsibull-build`` command lines. See `Activating
          global completion <https://pypi.org/project/argcomplete/#activating-global-completion>`__
          in the argcomplete README for how to enable tab completion globally. This
          will also tab-complete Ansible commands such as ``ansible-playbook`` and
          ``ansible-test`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/611).

          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/620).
      bugfixes:
        - Add explicit dependency on PyYAML, since we directly use it (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/619).
        - announcements - fix link to ansible-core changelog in the Ansible package
          release announcement template (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/621).
      minor_changes:
        - Add dependency on antsibull-fileutils. Some functionality from antsibull-core
          is moving there, so we can use it from there directly (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/619).
        - Add subcommand ``lint-build-data`` for linting build data in ``ansible-build-data``
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/617).
        - Remove the mention of mailing lists from the Ansible README (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/613).

        - Antsibull now depends on antsibull-docs-parser 1.x.y (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/623).

          from ``collection-meta.yaml`` information (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/623).

    changes:
      breaking_changes:
        - The name of this project has been changed from ``antsibull`` to ``antsibull-build``
          to reflect that it provides the ``antsibull-build`` command and disambiguate
          this project from the other antsibull projects. For backwards compatibility
          purposes, the ``antsibull`` project on PyPI has been converted to an empty
          stub package that requires ``antsibull-build``, but users should immediately
          switch to the new name. The Git repository has also been moved to https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-build
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/issues/627, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/629).
