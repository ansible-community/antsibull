  0.4.0:
    release_date: '2020-06-01'
  0.40.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Fix ``rsync`` flags in build scripts generated by ``antsibull-docs sphinx-init``
        to allow Sphinx to not rebuild unchanged files (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/357).
      - Fix boolean logic error when ``--skip-indexes`` was used in ``antsibull-docs``
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/377).
      - Fix feature freeze handling after Beta 1 in build role (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/337).
      - Require Python 3.8 for Ansible 5 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/345).
      deprecated_features:
      - The ``antsibull-build single`` subcommand is deprecated. Use the ``prepare``
        and ``rebuild-single`` subcommands instead (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/341).
      major_changes:
      - Responsive parameter and return value tables. Also use RST tables instead
        of HTML blobs (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/335).
      minor_changes:
      - Add a changelog (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/378).
      - Allow to specify ``collection_cache`` in config file (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/375).
      - Allow to still use HTML blobs for parameter and return value tables. This
        can be controlled by a CLI option ``--use-html-blobs`` and by a global config
        option ``use_html_blobs`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/360).
      - Avoid prereleases when creating the ``.build`` file in ``antsibull-build new-acd``.
        The old behavior of including them can be obtained by passing the ``--allow-prereleases``
        option (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/298).
      - Change ansible-base references in documentation and code to ansible-core where
        it makes sense (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/353).
      - During docs build, only write/copy files to the destination that have changed
        assuming they are not too large (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/374).
      - Improve ``build-ansible.sh`` script integrated in the release tarball (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/369).
      - Improve ``galaxy-requirements.yaml`` generation (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/350).
      - Mention new options in the porting guide (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/363).
      - Modify ``thread_max`` default value from 80 to 8 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/365,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/370).
      - Move modules to beginning of plugin index (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/336).
      - Remove unnecessary Python 2 boilerplates (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/371).
      - Simplify ansible-core dependency in ``setup.py`` with compatibility operator
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/346).
      - Split ``antsibull-build single`` subcommand into ``prepare`` and ``rebuild-single``
        subcommand (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/341).
      - Stop using deprecated Python standard library ``distutils.version`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/372).
      - Various improvements to the build role (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/338).

  0.40.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Fix bug in collection enum for docs generation, which caused role FQCNs to
        be mangled (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/379).
      release_summary: Bugfix release.

  0.40.2:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Fix ``rsync`` call when ``antsibull-docs sphinx-init`` is used with ``--squash-hieararchy``
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/382).
      - Fix invalid HTML in return value RST tables. Closing ``</div>`` were missing
        for a wrapping ``<div>`` of every content cell, causing problems with some
        text-based browsers (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/issues/386,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/387).
      - Work around Python argparse bug by using vendored class for all Python versions
        until the bug is fixed in argparse. This makes ``--help`` work for all antsibull-docs
        subcommands (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/384).
      release_summary: Bugfix release.

  0.41.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - If plugin parsing fails for ``antsibull-docs plugin``, handle this more gracefully
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/393).
      - Improve error message when plugin specified for ``antsibull-docs plugin``
        cannot be found (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/383).
      - When using ``--use-html-blobs``, malformed HTML was generated for parameter
        aliases (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/388).
      minor_changes:
      - Add ``--fail-on-error`` to all antsibull-docs subcommands for usage in CI
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/393).
      - Allow to select a different Sphinx theme for ``antsibull-docs sphinx-init``
        with the new ``--sphinx-theme`` option (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/392).
      - Fully implement ``antsibull-docs collection``. So far ``--current`` was required
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/383).
      - Mention the plugin type more prominently in the documentation (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/364).
      - Remove email addresses and ``(!UNKNOWN)`` from plugin and role author names
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/389).
      - Support new ``keyword`` field in plugin documentations (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/329).
      - The ``conf.py`` generated by ``antsibull-docs sphinx-init`` will be set to
        try resolving intersphinx references to Ansible's ``devel`` docs instead of
        a concrete Ansible version (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/391).

  0.42.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Fix ansible-core version parsing for ``ansible-doc`` docs parsing backend
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/401).
      major_changes:
      - Allow collections to specify extra links (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/355).
      - From Ansible 6 on, improve ``setup.py`` to exclude unnecessary files in the
        Python distribution (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/342).
      minor_changes:
      - Add a new docs parsing backend ``ansible-core-2.13``, which supports ansible-core
        2.13+ (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/401).
      - Add an autodetection ``auto`` for the docs parsing backend to select the fastest
        supported backend. This is the new default (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/401).
      - Add option ``--no-semantic-versioning`` to ``antsibull-lint changelog-yaml``
        command (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/405).
      - If the role is used to build a non-alpha or first beta version and the bulid
        file does not exist, it is created instead of later failing because it does
        not exist (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/408).
      release_summary: Major feature release preparing for Ansible 6. Also adds support
        for the new collection links file, and improves the attributes tables.

    release_date: '2022-03-26'
  0.42.0b1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Fix filename of mentioned ansible-core porting guide in Ansible's porting
        guide introductionary comment (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/398).
      - antsibull-docs will no longer traceback when it tries to process plugins not
        found in its own constant but are available in ansible-core (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/404).
      major_changes:
      - Building Ansible 6+ now builds wheels next to the source tarball (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/394).
      - Remove Ansible 2.9 / ansible-base 2.10 checks from ``setup.py`` for Ansible
        6 so that we can finally ship wheels. This change is only active for Ansible
        6 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/394).
      minor_changes:
      - Change more references to ansible-base to ansible-core in the code (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/398).
      - Mention the ``ansible-core`` major version in the Ansible porting guide (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/397).
      - Redo attributes table using the same structure as the options and return value
        table. This improves its look and adds a linking mechanism (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/401).
      release_summary: Beta release to allow merging of https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/74963.

      bugfixes:
      - antsibull-docs sphinx-init - the ``--fail-on-error`` option resulted in an
        invalid ``build.sh`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/409).

  0.43.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Prevent crashing when non-strings are found for certain pathnames for ``antsibull-docs
        lint-collection-docs`` and ``antsibull-lint collection-docs`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/411).
      minor_changes:
      - Add ``lint-collection-docs`` subcommand to ``antsibull-docs``. It behaves
        identical to ``antsibull-lint collection-docs`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/411,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/issues/410).
      - Support ``MANIFEST.json`` and not only ``galaxy.yml`` for ``antsibull-docs
        lint-collection-docs`` and ``antsibull-lint collection-docs`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/411).
      release_summary: Feature release.

    release_date: '2022-03-30'
  0.44.0:
    changes:
      deprecated_features:
      - The antsibull-lint command is deprecated. Use ``antsibull-changelog lint-changelog-yaml``
        instead of ``antsibull-lint changelog-yaml``, and use ``antsibull-docs lint-collection-docs``
        instead of ``antsibull-lint collection-docs`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/412,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/issues/410).
      known_issues:
      - When upgrading from antsibull < 0.44.0 to antsibull 0.44.0+, it could happen
        that the ``antsibull-docs`` binary is removed due to how pip works. To make
        sure the ``antsibull-docs`` binary is present, either first uninstall (``pip
        uninstall antsibull``) before installing the latest antsibull version, or
        re-install ``antsibull-docs`` once the installation finished (``pip install
        --force-reinstall antsibull-docs``) (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/414).
      major_changes:
      - The ``antsibull`` package now depends on ``antsibull-core`` and ``antsibull-docs``,
        and most code was moved to these two packages. The ``antsibull-docs`` CLI
        tool is now part of the ``antsibull-docs`` package as well. The behavior of
        the new version should be identical to the previous version (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/414).
      release_summary: Split up antsibull into multiple PyPi packages (``antsibull-core``,
        ``antsibull-docs``, and ``antsibull``). **Note** that upgrading is a bit more
        complicated due to the way ``pip`` works! See below for details.

  0.45.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - The ``build-release`` role no longer uses poetry to run antsibull, but assumes
        that antsibull is installed. To revert to the old behavior, set the Ansible
        variable ``antsibull_build_command`` to ``poetry run antsibull`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/420).
      minor_changes:
      - Add ``antsibull-build`` subcommand ``validate-deps`` which validates dependencies
        for an ``ansible_collections`` tree (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/416).
      - Check collection dependencies during ``antsibull-build rebuild-single`` and
        warn about errors (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/416).
      - In the ``build-release`` role, stop shipping a separate ``roles/build-release/files/deps-to-galaxy.py``
        script and use the new galaxy-requirements.yaml style file created during
        release preparation (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/417).
      - Update Ansible's ``README.rst`` to focus on Ansible package details (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/415).
      - When preparing a new Ansible release with ``antsibull-build prepare`` or ``antsibull-build
        single``, create a galaxy-requirements.yaml style file next to the dependencies
        file (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/417).

      bugfixes:
      - The ``build-release`` role now no longer ignores collection prereleases of
        collections for the alpha releases (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/420).

  0.46.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - In the build-release role, when ``antsibull_force_rebuild`` is true, delete
        the existing python wheel in addition to the release tarball (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/427).
      - Remove various empty lines from generated ``setup.py`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/issues/424,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/425).
      - Use ``packaging.version`` instead of (indirectly) ``distutils.version`` to
        check whether the correct ansible-core version is installed (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/426).
      minor_changes:
      - Avoid including the complete condensed changelog of collections added to Ansible
        to that Ansible release's changelog and porting guide entries (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/428).
      - The ``build-release`` role now also uses ``antsibull_data_reset`` to prevent
        regeneration of ``build-X.ansible`` for alpha and beta-1 releases (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/422).

      bugfixes:
      - When preparing a new Ansible release, bump the ansible-core version to the
        latest bugfix version (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/430).
      minor_changes:
      - In the release role, automatically set ``antsibull_build_file`` and ``antsibull_data_dir``
        based on ``antsibull_ansible_version`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/430).
      - The release role has now an argument spec (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/430).

  0.49.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - The ``build-release`` role now depends on the ``community.general`` collection
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/432).
      bugfixes:
      - Fix typo in generated MANIFEST.in to list the existing file ``README.rst``
        instead of the non-existing file ``README`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/435).
      - When preparing a new Ansible release, only use pre-releases for ansible-core
        when the Ansible release itself is an alpha pre-release. This encodes that
        the first beta release of a new major Ansible release coincides with the ansible-core
        GA (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/436).
      minor_changes:
      - Allow to copy the files used to create the source distribution and wheels
        to a new directory during ``antsibull-build rebuild-single`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/435).
      - Perform minor refactoring of the ``build-release`` role, mostly concerning
        ``tasks/tests.yml``. This reduces use of ``shell`` and ``set_fact``, makes
        the role more robust, and replaces short names with FQCNs (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/432).
      - Show warnings emitted by building the source distribution and/or wheels (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/435).
      - The files in the source repository now follow the `REUSE Specification <https://reuse.software/spec/>`_.
        The only exceptions are changelog fragments in ``changelogs/fragments/`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/437).

      - Adjust release role to work around a bug in the current beta version of ansible-core
        2.14 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/447).
      - Fix typing errors in the ``multiple`` subcommand (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/443).
      minor_changes:
      - Added galaxy ``requirements.yml`` file as ``build-release`` role depends on
        ``community.general`` collection (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/432)
      - Define minimal Python requirement for Ansible X depending on X, under the
        assumption that ansible-core's Python requirement is increased by one version
        every two ansible-core major releases, and that every Ansible major release
        corresponds to an ansible-core major release from Ansible 5 on (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/448).
      - The ``build-release`` role fails to execute when ``./build/antsibull-build-data``
        doesn't exist and when the ``antsibull_data_reset`` variable is set to ``false``
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/442).
      - When building Ansible 6.3.0 or newer, fail on collection dependency validations
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/94, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/440).

      - The ``python_requires`` information is now extracted from ansible-core and
        stored in the ``.build`` and ``.deps`` files instead of guessing it from the
        Ansible version (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/449).

        subcommands. Previously, the ``--collection-dir`` option was added to the
        wrong CLI argument parser and not exposed to users. (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/461).
      - Use compatibility code instead of trying to run ``asyncio.run`` directly,
        which will fail with Python 3.6 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/459).
      release_summary: Bugfix release. The next minor release will no longer support

      - The antsibull-docs dependency has been removed (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/451).
      minor_changes:
      - Add a ``validate-tags`` subcommand to ensure that collection versions in an
        Ansible release are tagged in collections' respective git repositories (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/456).
      - Make compatible with antsibull-core 2.x.y (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/463).

        on your use-case (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/451).

        been removed. Use ``collection`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/451).
      - The deprecated ``build-multiple`` subcommand of ``antsibull-build`` has been
        removed. Use ``multiple`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/451).
      - The deprecated ``build-single`` subcommand of ``antsibull-build`` has been
        removed. Use ``single`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/451).
      - The deprecated ``new-acd`` subcommand of ``antsibull-build`` has been removed.

  0.53.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Correct Python version classifiers in the ansible ``setup.py`` template. Limit
        the Python 3.8 classifer to ansible 5 and 6 and add the Python 3.11 classifier
        to ansible >= 7 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/479).
      - Do not crash when the ``changelogs/changelog.yaml`` file of a collection cannot
        be loaded (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/issues/481, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/482).
      minor_changes:
      - Add ``--tags-file`` option to the ``single``, ``rebuild-single``, and ``prepare``
        subcommands. This allows including a collection git tags data file in ansible-build-data
        and the ansible sdist (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/476/).
      - Add ``pyproject.toml`` to ansible sdist to use the ``setuptools.build_meta``
        `PEP 517 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/>`__ backend. Tools that still
        call ``setup.py`` directly will work the same as they did before (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/471).
      - Bump minimum ``antsibull-core`` requirement to 1.5.0. It contains changes
        that are needed for the new ``--tags-file`` option (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/476/).

        explicitly declare the dependencies on ``packaging``, ``semantic_version``,
        ``aiofiles``, ``aiohttp``, and ``twiggy`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/487).

  0.55.0:
    changes:
      deprecated_features:
      - The ``multiple`` and ``collection`` subcommands are deprecated and will be
        removed soon. They were never used to our knowledge except in the exploratory
        phase before the first Ansible 2.10 releases, have no test coverage, and might
        not even work at all. If you are actively using them and are interested in
        keeping them, please create an issue in the antsibull repository as soon as
        possible (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/505).
      major_changes:
      - Change pyproject build backend from ``poetry-core`` to ``hatchling``. ``pip
        install antsibull`` works exactly the same as before, but some users may be
        affected depending on how they build/install the project (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/490).
      minor_changes:
      - Add a ``-I`` / ``--ignore`` and a ``--ignores-file`` flag to the ``antsibull-build
        validate-tags`` and ``antsibull-build validate-tags-file`` subcommands to
        ignore errors for certain collections (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/491).
      - Make compatible with deprecations issued by newer setuptools releases (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/issues/433,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/502).
      - Use the pypa ``build`` tool to build wheels and source distributions for ansible
        in an isolated environment. This replaces direct calls to ``python setup.py
        bdist_wheel`` and ``python setup.py sdist`` which are deprecated (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/492).

        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/issues/532, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/533).
      minor_changes:
      - Antsibull now no longer depends directly on ``sh`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/514).
      - Antsibull now uses ``sys.executable`` instead of the first ``'python'`` in
        ``$PATH`` to call the PyPA build tool (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/514).
      - Make ``dep_closure`` errors clearer by including the offending collection's
        version in the message (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/531).
      - Move setuptools configuration into the declarative ``setup.cfg`` format for
        Ansible 9 and above. ``ansible`` sdists will still contain a ``setup.py``
        file, but we recommend that users move to tools like ``pip`` and ``build``
        and the PEP 517 interface instead of setuptools' deprecated ``setup.py`` interface
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/530).
      - Now depends antsibull-core 2.0.0 or newer; antsibull-core 1.x.y is no longer
        supported (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/514).
      - release playbook - run ``antsibull-build validate-tags-file`` to ensure that
        collections follow the Release Management section of the Collection Requirements
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/518).
      release_summary: This release adds a couple new features and drops support for
        older ansible versions.
      removed_features:
      - Remove code to build ansible versions < 6.0.0 from the ``setup.py`` template
        and elsewhere in the codebase. ``antsibull-build`` will error out if a user
        attempts to build an unsupported version (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/477,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/524).

        in the app context and are removed from antsibull-core 3.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/569).
      minor_changes:
      - Add a ``sanity-tests`` subcommand to run sanity tests accross the collection
        tree created by ``verify-upstreams`` and display the results (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/556).
      - Add a ``verify-upstreams`` subcommand to ensure that files in a collections'
        Galaxy collection artifact match its upstream repository (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/556).
      - Add new ``antsibull-build announcements`` command to generate release announcement

      - Add new ``antsibull-build send-announcements`` command to interactively send
        release announcements. Make sure to install ``pyperclip`` with ``pip install
        antsibull[clipboard]`` to fully take advantage of its functionality (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/573).
      - Add support for the latest antsibull-core v3 pre-release, ``3.0.0a1`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/586).
      - Adjust the ``pip install antsibull`` call in the ``build-ansible.sh`` script
        added to the ``ansible`` source distribution to use the version of antsibull
        used to build the ansible release (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/563).
      - Change the license from ``GPL-3.0-or-later`` to ``GPL-3.0-or-later AND Python-2.0.1``.
        Antsibull now contains a small amount of code derived from CPython (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/556).
      - Explicitly set up Galaxy context instead of relying on deprecated functionality
        from antsibull-core (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/570).
      - The Ansible changelog is now generated both in MarkDown and ReStructuredText
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/576).
      - The dependency on antsibull-changelog has been bumped to 0.24.0 or later (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/576).
      - '``ansible`` package README - add a link to the ``ansible-build-data`` issue
        tracker (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/554).'
