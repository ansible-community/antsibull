minor_changes:
  - Move ansible setuptools configuration into the declarative setup.cfg format.
    ``ansible`` sdists still contain a ``setup.py`` file,
    but we recommend that users move to tools like ``pip`` and ``build`` and
    the PEP 517 interface instead of setuptools' deprecated setup.py interface
    (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/530).
