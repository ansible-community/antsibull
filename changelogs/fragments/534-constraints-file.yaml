minor_changes:
  - "Support constraints files that allow tempoararily pinning collections
     without modifying the ansible-VERSION.build file.
     This adds a ``-constraints-file`` flag to the ``prepare`` and ``single``
     commands to enable reading dependencies from a constraints file.
     The flag takes an optional argument to specify the path to the constraints file
     and otherwhise defaults to ``ansible-{VERSION}.constraints``
     (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/534)."
  - "Require antsibull-core 2.1.0 or greater that supports constraints files
     (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/534)."
