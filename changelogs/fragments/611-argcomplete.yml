minor_changes:
  - "If you are using `argcomplete <https://pypi.org/project/argcomplete/>`__, you can now tab-complete ``antsibull-build`` command lines.
     See `Activating global completion <https://pypi.org/project/argcomplete/#activating-global-completion>`__ in the argcomplete README for
     how to enable tab completion globally. This will also tab-complete Ansible commands such as ``ansible-playbook`` and ``ansible-test``
     (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/611)."
