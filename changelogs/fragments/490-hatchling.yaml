major_changes:
  - Change pyproject build backend from ``poetry-core`` to ``hatchling``.
    ``pip install antsibull`` works exactly the same as before,
    but some users may be affected depending on how they build/install the
    project
    (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/490).
