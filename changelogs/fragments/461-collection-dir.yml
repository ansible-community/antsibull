removed_features:
  - "The ``--collection-dir`` option was removed from the ``antsibull-build`` subcommands ``build-collection``, ``build-multiple``, ``build-single``,
     ``changelog``, ``collection``, ``multiple``, ``new-acd``, ``new-ansible``, ``prepare``, ``rebuild-single``, and ``single``, which should never
     have had this option. The option was not used for these subcommands (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/461)."
