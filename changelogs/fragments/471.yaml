minor_changes:
  - Add ``pyproject.toml`` to ansible sdist to use the
    ``setuptools.build_meta`` `PEP 517 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/>`__
    backend. Tools that still call ``setup.py`` directly will work the same as
    they did before
    (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/471).
