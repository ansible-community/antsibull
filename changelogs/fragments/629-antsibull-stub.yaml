  - "The name of this project has been changed from ``antsibull`` to
    ``antsibull-build`` to reflect that it provides the ``antsibull-build``
    command and disambiguate this project from the other antsibull projects.
    For backwards compatibility purposes, the ``antsibull`` project on PyPI
    has been converted to an empty stub package that requires
    ``antsibull-build``, but users should immediately switch to the new name.
    The Git repository has also been moved to
    https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-build
    (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/issues/627,
    https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/629)."
