bugfixes:
  - When preparing a new Ansible release, only use pre-releases for ansible-core when the
    Ansible release itself is an alpha pre-release. This encodes that the first beta release of
    a new major Ansible release coincides with the ansible-core GA
    (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/436).
