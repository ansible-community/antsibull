major_changes:
  - "The ``antsibull`` package now depends on ``antsibull-core`` and ``antsibull-docs``, and most code was moved to these two packages.
     The ``antsibull-docs`` CLI tool is now part of the ``antsibull-docs`` package as well.
     The behavior of the new version should be identical to the previous version (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/414)."
