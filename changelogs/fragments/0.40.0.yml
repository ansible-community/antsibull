release_summary: Feature and bugfix release.
minor_changes:
  - Move modules to beginning of plugin index (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/336).
  - Simplify ansible-core dependency in ``setup.py`` with compatibility operator (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/346).
  - Improve ``galaxy-requirements.yaml`` generation (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/350).
  - Various improvements to the build role (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/338).
  - Responsive parameter and return value tables. Also use RST tables instead of HTML blobs (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/335).
  - Split ``antsibull-build single`` subcommand into ``prepare`` and ``rebuild-single`` subcommand (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/341).
  - Change ansible-base references in documentation and code to ansible-core where it makes sense (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/353).
  - Allow to still use HTML blobs for parameter and return value tables. This can be controlled by a CLI option ``--use-html-blobs`` and by a global config option ``use_html_blobs`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/360).
  - Mention new options in the porting guide (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/363).
  - Modify ``thread_max`` default value from 80 to 8 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/365, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/370).
  - Remove unnecessary Python 2 boilerplates (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/371).
  - Stop using deprecated Python standard library ``distutils.version`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/372).
  - During docs build, only write/copy files to the destination that have changed assuming they are not too large (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/374).
  - Allow to specify ``collection_cache`` in config file (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/375).
  - Improve ``build-ansible.sh`` script integrated in the release tarball (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/369).
  - Avoid prereleases when creating the ``.build`` file in ``antsibull-build new-acd``. The old behavior of including them can be obtained by passing the ``--allow-prereleases`` option (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/298).
  - Add a changelog (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/378).

  - Fix ``rsync`` flags in build scripts generated by ``antsibull-docs sphinx-init`` to allow Sphinx to not rebuild unchanged files (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/357).
  - Fix boolean logic error when ``--skip-indexes`` was used in ``antsibull-docs`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/377).
