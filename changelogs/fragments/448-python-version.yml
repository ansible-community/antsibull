  - "Define minimal Python requirement for Ansible X depending on X, under the assumption that ansible-core's Python
     requirement is increased by one version every two ansible-core major releases, and that every Ansible major release
     corresponds to an ansible-core major release from Ansible 5 on (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/448)."
