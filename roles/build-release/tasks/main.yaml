    msg: >-
      Build tested and complete!
      A changelog as well as a porting guide have probably been generated at {{ antsibull_data_dir }}.
      The changelog must stay in the ansible-build-data repository and can be sent as a pull request
      but the porting guide needs to be submitted to ansible/ansible:docs/docsite/rst/porting_guides.
