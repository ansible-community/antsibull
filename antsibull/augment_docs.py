    Add information on the strucfture of a dict value in options or returns.

    a deeply nested structure, for instance.)  They describe each entry into the dict.  When
    constructing documentation which uses that, it can be useful to know the hierarchy leads to
    that entry (for instance, to make a target for an html href).  This function adds that
    information to a ``full_key`` field on the suboptions' entry.
