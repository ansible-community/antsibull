The documentation for the @{ plugin_type }@ plugin, @{ plugin_name }@,  was malformed.

The errors were:

{% for error in nonfatal_errors %}
* @{ error| replace('\n', '; ') }@

{% endfor %}

File a bug with the `@{ collection }@ collection <https://galaxy.ansible.com/@{collection | replace(".", "/", 1)}@>`_ in order to have it corrected.
