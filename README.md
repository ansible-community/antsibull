Tooling for building various things related to Ansible

Scripts that are here:

* antsibull-build - Builds Ansible-2.10+ from component collections ([docs](docs/build-ansible.rst))
* antsibull-docs - Extracts documentation from ansible plugins
* antsibull-lint - Right now only validates ``changelogs/changelog.yaml`` files ([docs](docs/changelog.yaml-format.md))

This also includes a [Sphinx extension](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) `sphinx_antsibull_ext` which provides a minimal CSS file to render the output of `antsibull-docs` correctly.

A related project is [antsibull-changelog](https://pypi.org/project/antsibull-changelog/), which is in its [own repository](https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/).

Scripts are created by poetry at build time.  So if you want to run from
a checkout, you'll have to run them under poetry::

    python3 -m pip install poetry
    poetry install  # Installs dependencies into a virtualenv
    poetry run antsibull-build --help

.. note:: When installing a package published by poetry, it is best to use
    pip >= 19.0.  Installing with pip-18.1 and below could create scripts which
    use pkg_resources which can slow down startup time (in some environments by
    quite a large amount).

You can find a list of changes in [the Antsibull changelog](./CHANGELOG.rst).

Unless otherwise noted in the code, it is licensed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License v3 or, at your option, later.

antsibull is covered by the [Ansible Code of Conduct](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html).

## Using the Sphinx extension

Include it in your Sphinx configuration ``conf.py``::

```
# Add it to 'extensions':
extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc', 'sphinx.ext.intersphinx', 'notfound.extension', 'sphinx_antsibull_ext']
```

## Updating the CSS file for the Sphinx extension

The CSS file [sphinx_antsibull_ext/antsibull-minimal.css](https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/blob/main/sphinx_antsibull_ext/antsibull-minimal.css) is built from [sphinx_antsibull_ext/css/antsibull-minimal.scss](https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/blob/main/sphinx_antsibull_ext/src/antsibull-minimal.scss) using [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) and [postcss](https://postcss.org/) using [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) and [cssnano](https://cssnano.co/).

Use the script `build.sh` in `sphinx_antsibull_ext/css/` to build the `.css` file from the `.scss` file:

```
cd sphinx_antsibull_ext/css/
./build-css.sh
```

For this to work, you need to make sure that `sassc` and `postcss` are on your path and that the autoprefixer and nanocss modules are installed:

```
# Debian:
apt-get install sassc

# PostCSS, autoprefixer and cssnano require nodejs/npm:
npm install -g autoprefixer cssnano postcss postcss-cli
```

## Creating a new release:

If you want to create a new release::

    vim changelogs/fragment/$VERSION_NUMBER.yml  # create 'release_summary:' fragment
    antsibull-changelog release --version $VERSION_NUMBER
    git add CHANGELOG.rst changelogs
    git commit -m "Release $VERSION_NUMBER."
    poetry build
    poetry publish  # Uploads to pypi.  Be sure you really want to do this

    git tag $VERSION_NUMBER
    git push --tags
    vim pyproject.toml    # Bump the version number
    git commit -m 'Update the version number for the next release' pyproject.toml
    git push
