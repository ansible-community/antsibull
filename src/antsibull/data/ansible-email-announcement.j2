Hello everyone,

We're happy to announce the release of the Ansible {{ version }} package{% if is_prerelease %} pre-release{% endif %}!

Ansible {{ version }} depends on ansible-core {{ core_version }} and includes a curated set of Ansible collections that provide a vast number of modules, plugins, and roles.{% if is_major_release and is_prerelease %} This is a pre-release of Ansible {{ major_version }}.{% elif is_major_release %} This is the first stable release of Ansible {{ major_version }}.{% elif is_prerelease %} This is a pre-release of Ansible.{% endif %}

ansible-core is a separate package on which ansible depends. `pip install ansible` installs `ansible-core`, but it can also be installed independently of the ansible package.

The Ansible community package release schedule follows the Ansible Core release schedule, including, for example, delays for holidays. This means Ansible releases happen every four weeks through most of the year, but release dates may be delayed when Ansible Core releases are.

{{ ("Getting collection updates from Ansible " ~ major_version ~ " with older releases of ansible-core") | email_heading }}

Ansible {{ major_version }} depends on ansible-core {{ core_major_version }}. Depending on your needs, you can get collection updates as they ship in the Ansible “batteries included” package while continuing to use older versions of ansible-core.

See the ansible-galaxy requirements file based on the collections from Ansible {{ major_version }} for this use case:

{{ build_data_path }}/galaxy-requirements.yaml

After you download the requirements file, you can install the collections by running the following command:

```console
ansible-galaxy collection install -r galaxy-requirements.yaml
```

On behalf of the Ansible community, thank you and happy automating!

Cheers,
Ansible Release Management Working Group
