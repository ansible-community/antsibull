"""
Persist collection infornation used to build Ansible.

Build dependency files list the dependencies of an Ansible release along with the versions that are
compatible with that release.

When we initially build an Ansible major release, we'll use certain versions of collections.  We
don't want to install backwards incompatible collections until the next major Ansible release.
