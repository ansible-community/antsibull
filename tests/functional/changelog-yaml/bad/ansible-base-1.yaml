      bugfixes:
      - '**security issue** - The ``subversion`` module provided the password via
        the svn command line option ``--password`` and can be retrieved from the host''s
        /proc/<pid>/cmdline file. Update the module to use the secure ``--password-from-stdin``
        option instead, and add a warning in the module and in the documentation if
        svn version is too old to support it. (CVE-2020-1739)

        '
      - '**security issue** - Update ``AnsibleUnsafeText`` and ``AnsibleUnsafeBytes``
        to maintain unsafe context by overriding ``.encode`` and ``.decode``. This
        prevents future issues with ``to_text``, ``to_bytes``, or ``to_native`` removing
        the unsafe wrapper when converting between string types (CVE-2019-14856)

        '
      - 'AnsibleModule.run_command() - set ``close_fds`` to ``False`` on Python 2
        if ``pass_fds`` are passed to ``run_command()``. Since ``subprocess.Popen()``
        on Python 2 does not have the ``pass_fds`` option, there is no way to exclude
        a specific list of file descriptors from being closed.

        '
      - By passing the module_tmpdir as a parameter in the write_ssh_wrapper function
        instead of initalizing module_tmpdir via get_module_path()
      - '``AnsibleUnsafe``/``AnsibleContext``/``Templar`` - Do not treat ``AnsibleUndefined``
        as being "unsafe" (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/65198)'
      - ansible-galaxy - Utilize ``Templar`` for templating skeleton files, so that
        they have access to Ansible filters/tests/lookups (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69104)
      - 'ansible-galaxy - fix a bug where listing a specific role if it was not in
        the first path failed to find the role

        '
      - ansible-galaxy - fix regression that prenented roles from being listed
      - ansible-galaxy - properly list roles when the role name also happens to be
        in the role path (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67365)
      - get_url - Don't treat no checksum as a checksum match (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/61978)
      - get_url pass incorrect If-Modified-Since header (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67417)
      - git - when force=True, apply --force flag to git fetches as well
      - 'group - The group module was not correctly detecting whether a local group
        is existing or not with local set to yes if the same group exists in a non
        local group repository e.g. LDAP. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/58619)

        '
      deprecated_features:
      - hash_behaviour - Deprecate ``hash_behaviour`` for future removal.
      - script inventory plugin - The 'cache' option is deprecated and will be removed
        in 2.12. Its use has been removed from the plugin since it has never had any
        effect.
      minor_changes:
      - '''Edit on GitHub'' link for plugin, cli documentation fixed to navigate to
        correct plugin, cli source.'
      - A `vmware` module_defaults group has been added to simplify parameters for
        multiple VMware tasks. This group includes all VMware modules.
      removed_features:
      - core - remove support for ``check_invalid_arguments`` in ``AnsibleModule``,
        ``AzureModule`` and ``UTMModule``.
